# Serverless functions for Squizzy

This folder contains serverless used by the client Squizzy app to talk with the Sanity.io hosted datastore. These functions are made to work with [ZEITâ€™s Now](https://zeit.co/now) platform, but should be easily retrofitted into other serverless providers as well.
